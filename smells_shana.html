        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Kermit: Hi and welcome to UCLAradio.com this is Smells like Teen Spirituality with DJ Kermit and DJ Daydream. Thanks for tuning in on this Monday afternoon and if you’re regular listeners of our show, thanks for tuning in at our changed time, but the reason for this time change is so that we could <span style="font-weight: bold">have our lovely guest on today Shana, who is an intuitive</span> and also just a wonderful human being. And we’re going to be asking some thought-provoking and hopefully insightful questions that you guys can all follow along. And if you ever have any questions or you want to jump in you can use the chat feature on uclaradio.com and tell us what you’re thinking. With that do you want to open with anything?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: Hello everyone, my name is Shana. Nice to meet everyone, I say that with quote marks. You can’t see them because we’re on the radio, but they’re there.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: They’re there, they’re listening.

                <br><br>Sophie: Alright, so do you want to just open with a general question that will get things going and see where it takes us?

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Absolutely!
            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: I would love to know how you got your <span style="font-weight: bold">start in spirituality</span>?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: Okay, so the way that I got my start actually, I don’t know if you guys were even born for this, maybe just barely born for this.. The ‘94 earthquake?

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Nope, not born.

                <br><br>Shana: Okay wow, you guys are making me feel old. Okay I was really young during the ‘94 earthquake, I was about 4 years old. And the night before I started freaking out a little bit, and I wasn't one that was really prone to tantrums. But we had a dogs that had puppies at the time and I kept insisting that we had to move the puppies cause they were going to die in the earthquake. And finally my parents just moved the puppies so that I would…

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Stop talking?

                <br><br>Shana: … like chill yeah and go to sleep. And right when the earthquake hit, there was a mirror that fell where the puppies would have been.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Holy crap.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, so once everything kind of like died down, because we were kind of in the epicenter. So when everything kind of calmed down with the earthquake, my mom was like “Hey so you knew that and that was kind of weird, what else do you know?”

                <br><br>So I got really lucky that she was just really open to it, she encouraged it, her best friend taught me how to read the tarot when I was 8 years old. So it’s always been like second nature to me. When I was a little bit older and I decided I wanted to learn about witchcraft, my mom would buy me spellbooks. So then when I got a little bit older, around 18 or so, I decided I wanted to start formally studying witchcraft and so that just kind of led me to where I am today. Working at a witch store , being professional witch.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Professional witch, I want to have that on my resume. I guess we can, we all can.

                <br><br>Shana: Very true.
            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: Was your <span style="font-weight: bold">mom</span> a spiritual person?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: She knew that it was real, she believed in it. My grandmother was more spiritual I think. But we also, you know my grandma was born in the 40’s so that was a time that everyone was a lot more folky, brought a lot of culture from whatever country you were coming from and stuff like that.  So, my mom just thought it was quirky, she knew it was real, but it just wasn’t her thing so to speak.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Yeah.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Kermit: That’s so interesting, wow. So when did you start <span style="font-weight: bold">developing your intuition</span>? Is it something that you had to kind of work at and practice and continually practice to keep up or is it something that you just had and ran with?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: For me personally, it started with just having it and running with it, because I was so young when I started tapping into it and it wasn’t shut down. I believe that everybody is psychic, I think we all have it in us. And as children we seem to exercise it more because we don’t understand these boundaries and we’re not all about, “Well, this is our imagination” and stuff like that. But as we grow up and society tells us, “This isn’t real, this is your imagination, you can’t see auras, you’re making it up.” You stop seeing things.

                <br><br>Can you get it back? Absolutely. I think that your intuition is like a muscle. So the more you exercise it, the stronger it’s going to get. I exercise mine all the time, so yes, part of it is I got a kind of just roll with it and it was there. The other part is I did have to work towards sharpening it as well as understanding when it’s my intuition and when it’s just mumbo jumbo. So there are exercises that people can do to start figuring their intuition out, because everybody’s works in a different way.

                <br><br>This one actually really fun and it’s really easy. All you need is  a deck of playing cards. You use two people and one is a sender and one is a receiver. And you have to guess what color the card is. So you pick a card and let’s say it’s red, and you are the sender so you’re gonna start trying to tend that to the other person. So you’re going to think about the color red and what it looks like, you can say red in  your head and think “fire” “hot” “spicy,” whatever it is that is red to you. Then the person will guess it. Then the trick is to see how did you know it was red? Did you hear it did you feel heat did you taste something spicy in your mouth did you just know it, like how did it start? And so what this does is it helps you sharpen both sending and receiving, but it also starts to tell you how your intuition works like did you hear it, feel it what was it, because that’s how it works for you.
                That’s true, I think like some people, like your friend, what was his name? The one who saw auras?

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Oh, his name was Freddie.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, like some people very much have a visual intuition and it comes to them like that. But some people just have a feeling, or a sensory feeling or maybe it’s like...maybe my stomach issues are intuition!

                <br><br>*Laughter*

                <br><br>Shana: It totally could be. Some people have things like that, like where you get headaches and that means x, y and z. But when you see things and you know there’s actually like labels for this. Which is kind of funny because a lot of people think that clairvoyant just means psychic, and so people will ask all the time “Well are you clairvoyant? I want a clairvoyant” And I’m like, well no I don’t see things, but I am a psychic if that’s what you mean. So clairvoyant is when you can see things, clairaudient is when you can hear them and clairsentient is when you can feel them/just know them. So those are the three big clairs that you kind of see, so now you guys have labels for those too.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: During the pre-interview you mentioned that you are somewhat <span style="font-weight: bold">skeptical</span>, and I’m really curious about what you mean by that.</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: I think that it’s always healthy to be skeptical when people are claiming anything. I’m not even saying this is in a way of that I think people are liars. It’s just that you don’t know. Yes, I know that I am intuitie, I know that I am psychic, I will also prove it to you through a reading. That doesn’t mean I play stump the psychic, where you make me guess your name, because I won’t play that. You just, you’ll start knowing when people are legit. You have to give it a chance, but that also doesn’t mean that you should just blindly follow it.

                <br><br>I feel like sometimes people will truly believe stuff or believe… for instance where I see this a lot is where people think their house is haunted. And that’s like a really big one and people will just totally believe it and I’m like, “No, just you’re wiring is really bad and you need an electrician.” So, it’s good to be skeptical in those ways. And it’s just great to ask questions and challenge things, because that’s how you understand it more. And when you develop that higher understanding that’s how you practice your craft and have it grow and become better at what you’re doing.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, I think like the integration of skepticism and curiosity even in spirituality and your practice is really important. I think a lot of people who don’t touch upon it, kind of has this preconception in their head that if someone is a spiritual person or is a wiccan or you know has these practices that this is what they believe. They kind of put them in these boxes of beliefs that they don’t agree with, and so it becomes like the other. But when you introduce skepticism I feel like it becomes this very healthy, personalized religion or spirituality that everyone can have that… I don’t know how to word it exactly. My train of thought kind of got lost. But like the more skeptic you are, it’s much a more realistic view,  I guess, of spirituality - to have that natural curiosity.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, and I think that it’s good to be a little skeptical too, just because there are a lot of fakes out there, unfortunately.  And people that prey upon people that are naive or have a really desperate need to fix something in their life. So it’s also really good to be a little skeptical to make sure that you’re going to somebody that is trustworthy. Because you’re trusting somebody with a really big piece of your life, whether it be a big important issue that’s going on or just your own spiritual development. And so you want to make sure that is coming from a credible and legitimate source. So being a skeptic is nice and healthy. I think the best way to figure out whether or not you’re going to somebody that is trustworthy is kind of just word of mouth stuff, check yelp or just see what reviews are out there on somebody. Because if you can't really figure anything out, you don’t hear anything about the person you probably don’t want to hand them all of your money.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: Do you mind if we dive right into <span style="font-weight: bold">death?</span></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: Let’s dive right into death guys, that’s an easy transition!

                <br><br>(Laughing)

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: Heavy, but we’ve talked a little bit already in a pre-interview about the idea of <span style="font-weight: bold">haunted items</span> and I would love to get an explanation, I guess, about what makes something haunted and how it can attach itself to a sort of spirit, or what is your take on it?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: So the first thing when we start talking about haunted stuff is we have to approach it with the philosophy that there is a difference between spirits and ghosts. So spirits are just that. They’re spirits. They’re spirits of people or animals that have passed on, that have not just died but actually crossed over. So they’re not stuck, they’ve kind of found their peace. That kind of thing. And when that happens they can kind of come, they can visit, check on you. I’m sure everyone’s had that dream of grandma coming and hanging out and you wake up and you smell her perfume or something. That’s because grandma is a spirit, she’s come to visit and just say hello and just check on you, just that she’s visiting. Ghosts are stuck. Ghosts are spirits that have no crossed over and because of that it’s almost like they lack parts of themselves. So it’s like they’re not thinking correctly almost. And so that’s why it’s usually just like amplified aspects of something. So that’s why you get the ghosts that are really angry or the ghosts that are always around children and stuff like that. Maybe it was like a mother or something like that, you know? So, ghosts are the ones that attach themselves to objects, and they are the ones that haunt things in that traditional sense, because they are earthbound and they are stuck here.
            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Kermit: Do you think they pick the <span style="font-weight: bold">object they choose to possess</span> based on a characteristic or trait they were lacking while living?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: It tends to be stuff that they were attached to in life in some way, something that was significant to them. So, for instance, I actually have a haunted doll at home named Stephanie. Stephanie comes from this place, kind of around LA somewhere, I don’t actually know the neighborhood. But she back in the day belonged to somebody that was mentally challenged. ANd this woman was severely autistic and kind of had the IQ and personality of probably like a 6 year old? 8 year old? And she wasn’t very well taken care of, this was back in the 60’s when our mental institutions definitely needed a lot of help. So you can imagine what her life was like. And so the one thing that she had was this doll. And so when… I got it when my friends went to an estate sale and actually saw where this woman lived, and it was really horrible conditions. And the only thing there that was really nice or sweet was this doll. So that was like her only toy, that was the only thing that she had. And so when you get to meet Stephanie and when people work with that spirit, she’s very child-like. And so of course it’s like someone that sees themself like a child attached themself to a child’s toy and this case it was her only toy, so it very important, it was very special to her so it tends to not be something random. It tends to be something of great significance to them.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Yeah, that makes sense to me.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: I feel like the way media portrays a lot of ghosts and spirit things, it’s  really bad chaotic, bad energy type thing. And a lot of people kind of amplify that on the hype and have this unnecessary fear of it and all of that.

                <br><br>Shana: But that creates that negative energy though because...

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, that feeds it.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, you can manifest it really easily. So I think we’ve kind of created this really scary air to certain things and if enough people are believing in it and thinking about it and kind of going that way, of course it’s going to come. If you look for something, you’re going to eventually find it. But not all spirits are bad just like not all people are bad, even though there’s definitely some sucky ones out there. It’s kind of that same principle. But that said, I don’t think that people should mess with spirits or try to hold them in. A lot of people think it’s really cool and think it makes them special to live in a haunted house. And I get where that’s coming from, if you’ve seen enough ghost adventures and stuff, you want to run around like a douchebag and yell at ghosts. But they don’t belong here, this isn’t their world anymore. So trying to keep them here gets a little funky and glitchy so it is not something I really recommend.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, I feel like you’d want to treat them the way you treat people. Like you don’t walk around trying to trap people, and annoy people, and get them to answer all your questions. That’s just inconsiderate, like of course the people are going to get pissed at you.

                <br><br>Shana: Exactly. So you go about ghost hunt and stuff like that in a very polite way too. But yeah, yelling at them or trying to keep them around because you think it’s cool having that in your house, that doesn’t mean you have an invincible friend. You know?

                <br><br>DJ Kermit??: That’s not very respectful.

                <br><br>Shana: No, and that’s the thing: approach it with respect. That’s the best way I can put it, because you would want someone to approach you with respect. So it’s the same thing.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: The golden rule: treat others the way you want to be treated - spirits included.

                <br><br>(Laughter)

                <br><br>Shana: Exactly.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: Do you believe in <span style="font-weight: bold">reincarnation?</span></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: Absolutely, I totally believe in reincarnation. That doesn’t mean that all spiritual people do. For instance, my boss and a lot of the people at my work at the Green Man store don’t believe in reincarnation. So when I ask them, “So what do you think of these past life flashbacks that people have then?” They think it’s ancestral memory. So they think that it is actually an ancestor that is giving them a memory of theirs and it’s coming about in that period your life because there’s a message that you’re supposed to be getting out of it. Which, I thought was really interesting to kind of approach it that way and I think it could totally be it sometimes. But I do believe in past lives because I think that sometimes people are just really wise beyond their years for no reason. Or you have to look at why you’re weirdly attracted to a certain thing and you don’t know why and it doesn’t actually hold anything for you or in your family, but it’s there for some reason. So that’s kind of where I get this thing about past lives, is there is something there with it.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Kermit: Do you think that you’ve had <span style="font-weight: bold">past lives</span>? Do you think that you’ve accessed them or explored them?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: I have. I’ve had... When I was a little kid, I would have a dream all the time that was always the same that ended up with me getting stabbed in the back. All I knew was that I was somebody’s maid, like I was a maid and I would tell my mom all the time. And I actually have a birthmark right there, so I know I was stabbed there. And so there is the theory that our big birthmarks and things like that are actually scars from past lives.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: I love that.

                <br><br>Shana:  So I’ve seen some. I just think that the tricky thing is that sometimes it comes from ego like everyone thinks that they’re Cleopatra or something really good and lavish. And I think that when that happens you might want to really rethink that, because that may not be the case because if that were true then Cleopatra shredded herself into a like a hundred million different pieces. You know?

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, I think a lot of it probably comes with being honest with your yourself and honest with what you’re feeling and making sure your intentions are correct. Which is harder than it sounds. It’s really hard to be honest with yourself and open with yourself.

                <br><br>Shana: It’s very true, so I do think that they’re there, I just think that it’s just kind of tricky sometimes whether we really know if they’re accurate. But if it works for you and it makes sense for you and it’s explaining weird quirks that you have about yourself, then maybe that’s all that really matters. You know? But no, you’re not Cleopatra, just saying.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Maybe just one person… Maybe on person is.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, maybe just one person. I think Cleopatra is probably tired and is taking a nap in the afterlife.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: She’s chilling, she’s got a whole palace in the afterlife...all of her people.

                <br><br>Shana: Why come back?

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, why be a human again?

                <br><br>Shana: Right? She’s already done it and she did it good too, man.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: Do you think that regarding reincarnation... I think that I’ve heard a sort of theory that you enter into a life that will teach you a lesson that is important for you. Do you believe that basically there is a... Nah, I don’t know the word destiny gets really complicated, but that there’s a <span style="font-weight: bold">reason why you’ve entered the life you did?</span></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: Yeah, I think you’re talking about soul contracts basically.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Sure.

                <br><br>Shana: So, basically with that, and I do believe in that to a certain degree. I think that sometimes we take this a literal too literal, or it gives us an excuse not to take responsibility for our own actions. But what a soul contract is, is basically before you entered the life that you’re in now, your spirit signed up for certain things. You have entered into contracts, “I will learn about x, y, and z.” And so you will get dropped into certain situations in life because this is part of that soul contract. You signed up to be here, you know because you have to learn something. But now that you’re at this crossroads, you get to choose what comes next. So life really is a choose your own adventure. So destiny doesn’t work in that way of we’re predestined to do every single thing that we’re doing. No, we’re predestined to be in certain situations that are going to make us make decisions. What decision we make is up to us and that shows our integrity and virtue as a person.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: I really like that perspective and that take on it. I think it’s a good, a very good like balanced point of view. Because  a lot of people do have that black and white of either everything that we do is predestined and it doesn’t matter what we do, or none of it is predestined, everything is a choice, everything...like I’m choosing in free will, but there is a mix.

                <br><br>Shana: There’s a happy medium there. Yeah, like I do think that a lot of things happen for a reason, you know, but I think that when it comes to our behavior and that’s on us. And I think that all too often, spiritual people tend to use this as this really big crutch. And they use their spirituality of this crutch of “Oh no, it’s not my fault that I’m being an asshole… It’s the moon’s fault, it’s spirits’ fault, it’s mercury retrograde.” And it’s like, no, you’re just being an asshole, Sharon, relax.
                So there is that.

                <br><br>*Laughter*

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, I like the thought of spirituality as a tool to understand yourself and understand your actions and behaviors, but not necessarily justify them. Like it helps explain things, but it doesn’t take back or change the fact that what you do or say is still what you do or say and has consequences. Yeah, which is nice. It’s kind of like a moral code in a way.

                <br><br>Shana; It really is. It’s kind of funny how backwards it can be sometimes. Because I see so many people use it as a crutch, however it’s really the opposite. It’s supposed to teach you about accountability and being responsible for the energy that you’re putting it out there.

        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: Do you believe in <span style="font-weight: bold">soul families?</span></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: Soul families? That’s awesome I’ve never actually heard that word.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Really? Okay, this is something that my really good friend Carla believes that, kind of along the idea of soulmates. The idea that two people, if you meet someone and they seem incredibly familiar and there’s no reason why they should be, it’s because, along with kind of soul contracts, you have met them or knew them  in the past life. Maybe you had a familial relation, maybe they were your mother in a past life and now they’re your good friend or something.

                <br><br>Shana: I do believe that. I do believe in things like that. I’ve never heard the word soul family, I like that. Yeah, because I think we’ve all had that happen, I don’t think that it happens too often, but yeah, that’s a spirit that you’ve known before and you guys had some kind of connection and it’s still there. And it could be that you guys didn’t finish whatever it is that you guys had signed up to do, so here we are again to just complete everything and start off fresh. So I think that that’s a lovely concept too. And I think that I’ve met a couple of people that I think I’ve known before. And it’s really exciting for me to think about that, because there are people that I’ve met in this lifetime that I don’t think I’ve met before that I really hope I get to continue that relationship later with them.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: What do you think happens <span style="font-weight: bold">after you die</span>?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: Um, that’s a really good question. Sometimes I think about that and I’ve actually gotten into many kind of weird conversations about that because I do believe in reincarnation, but I also believe that spirits kind of hang out. So what’s to say that somebody that died six years ago hasn’t been reincarnated, and people will say “No, my grandma still visits me” But your grandma could be visiting you, but that’s just her spirit, that’s not her ghost. So what if that’s just her higher-self still checking in while another piece of her is finishing living a new life. So I do kind of see it that way. But I also think for the most part that we get the option whether or not we come back, because I do think there are certain things, once we’ve fulfilled the lesson that we were supposed to learn, I think that that’s when you enter into the idea of ascended masters and different things like that. So I definitely think that there are things beyond this lifetime, or living a bunch of lives on earth. I think that there’s a lot more out there and it just kind of depends on where we’re at with our own progress and journey with that.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: I think that’s true. I think that a lot of people kind of view it again as this black and white where you’re either on this earth or you’re not. Or you’ve passed on, or you’re still here. But I like the idea of spirits and souls as energy that is just very fluid and can kind of take many forms and travel many places. And who’s to say that it can’t both be in somebody that maybe you’ll meet down the line and also in a doll and also visiting you in dreams.

                <br><br>Shana: It just depends. Yeah I think it depends on the person and what they want, because you know there is our self that is, for instance, here in this room right now, but each of us have a higher self that is doing different things and that’s part of your spirit guides and things like that, that kind of make that up. So what’s to say that you’re not going to be reincarnated and this human part of your spirit is going to go into another body, but your higher self is still there, that doesn’t get reincarnated. That just simply is.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: I wanted to ask about what it is like professionally for you to be an intuitive. So some of the questions I had are, does it feel like <span style="font-weight: bold">emotional labor</span>? Is it draining? Does it feel like work to you?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: Yes and no. I love my job. I have one of the coolest jobs in the world, so on that level I don’t wake up in the morning going “F*ck, I have to go to work,” and like dragging my feet. So I don’t have that part of having a job, which is really nice. But I do think that it is emotional labor and it’s not one of those jobs where you can show up to and just go through the motions. Because we’ve all had those jobs where you can just kind of like.. You know you’re kind of sick or something, so you just check out and hope that your day goes by fast. You can’t do that in my line of work, because you have to be able to emotionally connect with these people and intuitively connect with them to know what they need. So I don’t get that opportunity to go through the motions, so if there are days where I’m just not feeling it, that means I’m going to go to work and not make any money that day because my spirits are like, “No, she’s not taking people today, just keep them away.” So there are those times where it does get emotionally or like a little draining and stuff like that depending on the situation, whether it’s just somebody that I really relate to and end up really invested in. Like I’ve had a lot of teenagers graduating from high school and kind of figuring themselves out that have come to me dealing with hiding their sexuality from their parents and stuff like that. And so on that level, I’m like man I really want to help you. And then I’ve also had people that have dark attachments and that does take a lot out of you, but I think that’s the importance of knowing boundaries and psychic protection. And if I have one day where I’m really drained from this one person, then that means I wasn’t doing my part to wear my witchy seatbelt.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Kermit: So how do you <span style="font-weight: bold">re-energize</span> yourself after being drained or protect yourself from over-exertion or prevent yourself from being tired for future clients or whatever. Because I feel like it’s got to be a little difficult if you have people already scheduled and you wake up one day and you’re not feeling it like how do you keep yourself on your toes and feeling spiritually well?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: Honestly, there are days when I go into work and I’m like, “I’m not feeling this” and I will just sit at my table and be like, “Okay guys,” to my spirit guides, “This is all you today. I am not helping at all, like you guys better show up or something’s going to suck really bad.” So, it’s not just me and that’s the thing that people have to remember. Being intuitive, being a psychic, and things like that, it’s not you. You’re just the conduit, you’re the conduit for something else. So, that is really applied in energy healing, people learn that a lot. You are just the vessel that light is channeled through. And it’s basically the same thing. So it’s not me as a person that is doing the reading and doing these things. It is my spirit guides accessing information and talking to your spirit guides, it just happens to be that I was the one that picked up the phone and I just got the message. So sometimes that is really nice on that one. My little trick for psychic protection and stuff is I’m a really big fan of black tourmaline. I know that everyone loves crystals, so that is my contribution to everyone’s crystal knowledge: black tourmaline is my jam when it comes to psychic protection. It is something that you do want to cleanse once in a while. So I do mine like once a week just because it’s with me constantly doing healings, dealing with other people and stuff like that. But I think once a month is fine to just cleanse it. It’s also good just to have I call it your psychic bubble that you put up and kind of put yourself in the energetic hamster ball so that you can go experience things and deal with people, but you don’t absorb it and take it on as your own.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: I feel like, putting myself in your shoes, it would be very hard for me not to over-empathize with people and absorb those emotions, cause I’m very much like a sponge.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, so you’re the one that needs the bubble and the black tourmaline because you’re an empath. That’s what it’s called, you’re an empath. Yeah, I mean it’s definitely hard sometimes, but it’s just learning those boundaries. And it’s also learning who to go above and beyond for. Because I have no problem going above and beyond for my clients. Like they all have my phone number, they can text me and get a pep talk when they need it and stuff like that. But I also know when people are actually willing to put in the work to help themselves and have a better life, and then there’s people that aren’t willing to put in that work and want a quick fix-all for everything. So I’m just like okay you have to kind of know, which ones are you really going to put it all out there for and who are you just going to answer those questions for. Just like friends or anything else, you have to kind of gauge the people.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: That’s very true, especially with friendships I think it’s relevant. Everyone has experiences with friendships at some point of friends that are maybe draining you or over-demanding without realizing it and having to set up those boundaries. In this case, they’re psychic for you. But in a lot of friendships it’s saying like hey, you’ve got to step back or hey, I need some alone time. The importance of  boundaries, I definitely think about it a lot, because I don’t have enough in my life. But recently I’ve been trying to set them down and I think it’s good to remind everyone that boundaries are very important. Because if you’re feeling icky or feeling gross about something, I feel like a lot of the times there’s a boundary that needs to be set somewhere.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Well, especially if you do readings in your home…

                <br><br>Shana: I am very particular about who I let into my home. I do work at the Green Man? Store, so everyone can see me there and that is like my safe space to have people that I don’t know come in. But I do readings out of my house, and it tends to be for people that I’ve already read for a few times. I’ve built this relationship with you and I trust you. I also live with two guys and dogs and everything else, so as long as they’re around...

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: ...and cats!

                <br><br>Shana: … and my cats. My cats actually are probably bigger than some of my dogs, so I could use them in a cat-launcher as self-defense. So yeah, so there is that safety issue, but I feel like that’s covered. But it’s really making sure I vibe with you first before I let you into my space.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: That’s important. And that’s important even just with building relationships. Like vibing with someone before letting them in and being vulnerable with them, like into your emotional space.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, exactly.. Because your home, that’s sign of yourself. That’s where you go to rest, recharge and nourish yourself. So you’ve got to be really particular about who you let in there.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: Do you think that being a psychic has <span style="font-weight: bold">alienated you</span> from anyone?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: You know I have to say that I feel very fortunate that that hasn’t really happened to me. I was kind of wondering what that was going to be like because we have the joke of being in the broom closet and not wanting people to know that you’re a witch. It’s totally a thing. One of my best friends is totally in the broom closet and so it’s really cute when she goes somewhere where she gets to be witchy. I’ve just never been one of those people who can be secretive about who I am. It was kind of a big leap, but I didn’t really care because I’m just one of those obnoxious and in-you-face people. I had one person get weird about it and not want to talk to me and I was okay with that because it wasn’t like something where I had this really profound relationship. So I feel like honestly I tell people and they’re like, “That’s really cool!” And maybe it’s just the time we’re in right now, where that’s just more of an acceptable thing to be.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, and I feel like you’ve embraced it since such a young age that if anyone were going to alienate you or not agree with you or judge you for it, then it happened when you were young.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah and that didn’t happen.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, and then you draw the people to you who you become friend with because why would you want to be friends with someone who doesn’t accept what you believe in?

                <br><br>Shana: Exactly. So I did get made of and stuff like that growing up. My favorite story, I think I may have already told you guys this one….

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Oh, but tell everyone! It’s the best.

                <br><br>Shana: I was in middle school and I got called into the counselor’s office and there was a girl there. I hadn’t seen her before, didn’t know her name and apparently we were in the same grade. And I got in trouble because I had put a curse on her! And so my mom was called, it was this whole thing and so I made it a point to know who she was and track her down later and I found her and I ripped out a piece of her hair and I held it up and I showed her and I was like, “Now I am going to curse you.”

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: That’ll teach her.

                <br><br>Shana: It really did. Because that is the joy of the human mind and the power of what we can manifest into our lives. The best curse is to just tell somebody that you cursed them and let them do the rest.

                <br><br>*Laughter*

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: That’s some psychological warfare.

                <br><br>Shana: It really is.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Kermit: I know you <span style="font-weight: bold">teach a lot of classes</span> at the Green Man. What are some of your favorites?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: I love teaching magical housekeeping. I love cleaning, it’s one of my favorite things to do. I love being organized. Living with a bunch of guys and animals, which are basically more civilized than the guys most of the time, it’s hard to keep my place clean which means always I get to do my magical housekeeping. But it’s really great to teach people how to keep your energy clean through mopping your floors and kind of blending it all together. I just recently taught practical protection magic and that was actually really fun too. So talking about being just a badass And that’s kind of part of the protection, just feeling like you’re unfuckwithable and letting that protect you. But my other favorite class is lazy witchery, just because I am super lazy and I embrace that and you can totally be very effective with your magic while being in epic sloth mode.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: I love that, and I think it’s very interesting because recently I’ve been getting more into reading about wicca and herbalism and magic and spells and all of that. And it’s very overwhelming jumping right into it because there are a lot of tools that you need, there are a lot of steps to take, and a lot of aspects of it that seem very time-consuming. Every lazy bone in my body is like *groans.*

                <br><br>Shana: I think when I started getting really into witchcraft it was the same thing. And then when I did do a spell, I used 8 million different ingredients and I did this and I did that and now like I just like sharpie something on a bay leaf and burn and be like “Fuck yeah, I witchcrafted!” You know you don’t really need all that much. And when it comes to tools that is the thing, you go oh my god I need all this stuff, it’s going to be so expensive. And you have to remember that your magic doesn’t come from your (i have no idea what that is/how to spell it), or your wand, or anything else. It comes from you. These are all just tools, so none of it is actually necessary at all. You can totally do magic without any of these things,  just your pure intention and whatever you have around you that you can use. And DIY everything that you can, because the more energy and effort you put into the things the more juicy and powerful it’s going to be anyways. So, don’t feel overwhelmed at the idea that you have to go spend $800 at a witch store, buying all of this stuff - you don’t. It’s nice to have, I definitely like having the bling, but you don’t need it, it doesn’t make you any less of a witch to not have these things.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, I think that’s important to remember. Especially for listeners who are maybe interested in witchcraft or interested in learning about it and curious about it. You don’t have to go out and get a bunch of crystals and candles or herbs and stuff like that to start. You can do something as simple as, like Ashley and I on New Years, would write things we wanted to let go of and burn them in our little abalone shell and there you go - Boom! Spell, magic, witcher.

                <br><br>Shana: Perfect, yep!

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: We put out a mason jar for moonwater yesterday.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, that was very, we just filled a mason jar with rainwater and I put lavender in it and trapped some sage smoke in it. And we set it out on top of our car during the full moon and just kind of let it sit there and now it just has that energy and that memory.

                <br><br>Shana: That’s awesome, that’s wonderful.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Yeah, because of you. Thank you.

                <br><br>Shana: Of course!

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, wonderful pro-tip. Next full moon, guys, do it.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, if you get filtered water you can make tea, throw it in your bath. Really whatever you can can do with water you can do with moon water, it just makes it have some juju with it.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: It’s an energy. It makes you think of the moon and nature. All lovely things.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: We’re nearly running out of time, but I had a few more quick sort of questions.

                <br><br>Shana: Yes, go for it.

            </h3></div>
        <button class="accordion" style="font-family: 'Elsie'">DJ Daydream: What are some common <span style="font-weight: bold">misconceptions</span> you’ve noticed people have? Maybe about tarot or energy reading, are there any?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 style="font-family: 'Pontano Sans'">Shana: I mean the biggest one is that people think I worship Satan.

                <br><br>*Laughter*

                <br><br>Shana: That’s a really big one: That all witches are Satanists, and a lot of witches don’t even believe in Satan. So let’s just start there, I mean some do, but not all of them. And if you’ve ever met an actual Satanist, I’m not talking about devil-worshiper, I’m talking about Satanist - because they’re different - they’re actually pretty cool people. So, I actually have some friends that are Satanists and they’re very logical people, and they just get shit done. So there is that, I get a lot of that I am a Satanist. But it’s also just people thinking that I can wave a magic wand and all the problems disappear. They think that doing a spell, like boom, it’s done and everything is going to be fix they don’t have to put in any work, and that is not how it works. It’s basically whenever you craft magic, you’re cutting a deal. You’re coming to a compromise with the universe. You’re saying if I do this, then you have to do that. So if you’re not doing this, the universe isn’t going to do that. So you have to show up to the plate too.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: That makes sense. I mean it makes sense that magic and spells help you access certain parts of yourself and  practice intuition and willpower and all of these things. But it gives you the tools - you still have to use these tools. You can’t just say like I’m going to light this piece of paper on fire and say, “I’m not going to be sad about my dad’s sickness anymore,” or “I’m not going to be said about my pet dying or etcetera etcetera...

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, you have to do what you need to to heal yourself. And I think that’s actually the biggest problem I run into, is heart-healing magic. I know how to do it, it definitely takes the edge off, but I can’t help you get over your ex-boyfriend if you keep texting him.

                <br><br>*Laughter*

                <br><br>Shana: You know, things like that. A really good example though, of how magic works and putting in the work is if you’re going to do a quick money spell, go to work. Go to work, money isn’t going to magically appear, but you go to work. And let’s say you’re in a commissioned position, you go to work and you’re on you A-game, you’re probably going to double or triple you’re money that day. Because that candle helps. So, things like that.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Yeah, I know, I had a psychic reading once and she just over the phone said, “Yeah, well, there’s a soul contract and I erased it and everything is fine now.” And I was just like, that doesn’t feel right.

                <br><br>Shana: Yes, I’ve had that, where people come to me asking me to renegotiate soul contracts. And I’m like, dude, I am not a lawyer. Your spirit does not need a lawyer, you don't get to back out, there is no loophole.

                <br><br>*Laughter*

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: I feel like you have to do something there...

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: The contract is made. You can’t just shred the spiritual contract.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Yeah!

                <br><br>Shana: Can you imagine how easy life would be if we could do that?

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Get out of jail free card!

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Yeah like op - it’s gone!

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: That’s called denial.

So the the chakras are the 7 energy points in the body that rule over different parts of your spirit, personality, body and everything like that. So we can tell a lot about what’s going on with the person’s life by what part of their body has an owee or different things like that. Reiki is about replenishing and rebalancing the chakras. So, we can kind of do that to help just to relax us, manage stress, get us more connected with spirit and things like that.

So, yeah, I would say it probably does line up with. At least with my practice I can definitely see that. I don’t really think about people’s auras too much, because I only see certain people’s auras, it’s really weird. And I can never tell who it’s going to be. Certain people will just sit down, and I’m like, “Look at that pretty glow on you,” but it doesn’t happen all the time.

So if you wanted to learn about magic and didn’t know where to start, come check out one of our classes. We have ones that are like 9 weeks long, we have one day classes, and we also do public rituals so that you get to experience magic in action in a very safe environment. So it’s a really wonderful place for anybody of any type of spiritual belief system because we’re a pretty mixed group. And also pretty mixed level of experience. Whether you have no idea what you’re doing, but you want to see or you’ve been doing this your whole life, you’re going to learn something. You’re going to experience something. So, you can always find me at the Green Man store, but you can also find me online. You can find me on Facebook, my website, my Instagram, all of those things, @IntuitiveShana. So yeah check it out, and I’ll always post about the different rituals that are coming up, different classes, shows and I mean I’m always up to some magical mischief. So there’s definitely something to do.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Yeah, I’m so excited to go to your next burlesque show.

                <br><br>Shana: Yes, so I’m the co-producer of a burlesque show called Bell Booking Candle and our next one is February 13th and it is my birthday show and I am very excited for it. The subtitle for it is “Crossroads” so it’s going to be New Orleans conjure them.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Oh, I love it.

                <br><br>Shana: So this is one of my favorite shows, it is just so much fun.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Cannot wait.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: We should go…

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Yeah! Group radio trip.

                <br><br>Shana: Come check it out, take pictures, and witness the insanity. We definitely do some obnoxious and weird things sometimes.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: I love it, it’s freeing.

                <br><br>Shana: It really is, you know, I was kind of wondering about that when I first started getting into burlesque. Like isn’t this something that’s going to make you feel vulnerable? And it’s the total opposite. You’re just so empowered, you’re the only one on stage and there’s everyone looking at you so you think it’s going to be weird. But you don’t even think about the way it’s.. You can just see what I tell you you’re going to see, and you’re going to feel what I tell you you’re going to feel. My favorite thing to do is make people uncomfortable, I call it fear boners.

                <br><br>*laughter*

                <br><br>Shana: All of my acts make you feel something, make you uncomfortable, whether it’s supposed to be creepy and scary… like the act I’m doing in February can be a little unnerving for some people. I also have some that are just really sad, and people will contact me afterwards, “So I thought about how you can change your deer act and make it funny at the end,” and I’m like, “I don’t want it to be funny, I want it to be sad. I just made you feel something.”

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Yeah, the whole art of it and the beauty of it is how the audience is affected by it and what they think afterwards and the thoughts and feelings it provokes in them.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, because the exciting thing about burlesque, in general, is that everybody knows the end game. Your audience knows that at the end of your act you’re going to be naked. So we all know that already, so why do you go? You go because you don’t know HOW it’s going to happen. And that’s where you get to get creative and start having fun with it.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: That sounds wonderful and I feel like that’s a great way to whet the listeners’ appetite and get them excited to research this and contact Shana. We will post all of the contact information and everything on our Instagram @smellsliketeenspirituality links for the websites, etc. And you can start practicing and looking into all of this yourself. If this show inspired you, write a note to yourself, burn it, put out some moon water tonight. Do something for yourself that makes you feel good.

                <br><br>DJ Daydream: Thank you for coming Shana.

                <br><br>Shana: Yeah, thank you so much for having me.

                <br><br>DJ Kermit: Alrighty, well have a wonderful day you all, thanks for tuning in.
